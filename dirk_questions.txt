===================================== RECORDER =====================================
Changing the values to mV

Currently the values are float type, which has 7 decimals precision
Using float with 10-4 to 10-5 values gives too little space to work with the numbers

Changing the values from float to double type can give data loss, since these 2 floating-point
data types use different Binary conversion formats on the CPU

Also the libraries (dl_live_data) uses float, so the float-double conversion cannot be avoided

Therefore, the easiest would be to have bigger numbers comming from the recorder

- Delay on start recording, there is some random(?) data at the begining


Something we forgot to mention yesterday, the recorder needs to be restarted evrytime we run any program. When the connection is closed (smpt_close_serial_port), if it's not restarted soon afterwards(smpt_open_serial_port), the programe cannot connect to it again.
This happens with both IngestTest and SAS programmes. Is there any way to avoid this?

We are still waiting for an example to turn down the sampling frequency.

===================================== STIMULATOR =====================================
V It takes around 9s to start the stimulation on the first repetition
	
V It takes around 2.5s for the send_stop_cmd to actually happen (after been sent)

You told us that the ramp value has to be >0. Is there any other parameters with values restrictions?
