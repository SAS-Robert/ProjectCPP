-Compensate the stimulator signal
-Start stimulator, check stimulator (voluntary EMG) -> check if it stops or not?
Separate FES from EMG
-Separate recorder from stimulator?

-How do signals look while stimulating and when not.


-> Check that the patient is continously trying to go over the threshold
-> Deactivate the movement when the robot goes under the threshold, so the patient has to keep pushing and not relaxing

Maximum threshold? -> Recording the patient doing a very strong push
	-> Then set up the threshold in between
Only resting EMG signal is bad to calibrate

Adaptative threshold

Put electrodes separately (from EMG and FES).
eg.: FES in the knee and EMG in the gluteus/cuadriceps
Necessary to check good locations for the electrodes.

--> Look at girls' project references from Threshold
