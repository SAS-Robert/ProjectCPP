============ UPPER LEG ===================
first 2 recordings -> resting (one on the ground, one on the start position)
3rd recording -> MVC discard
4th recording -> MVC another exercise (exercise motion was recorded again)
5th recording -> high resistance -> level 10, 20 rep
6th recording -> medium resistance -> level 5, 20 rep
7th recording -> low resistance -> level 1, 20 rep
8th recording -> subresistance -> level 3, weird exercise

============ LOWER LEG ===================
first 2 recordings -> resting
3rd recording -> MVC 
4th recording -> high resistance -> level 10, 20 rep
5th recording -> medium resistance -> level 5, 20 rep
6th recording -> low resistance -> level 1, 20 rep
7th recording -> subresistance -> level 1, weird exercise

To come back on the start position, it is easier just to relax than let the robot take the user back
