This program uses the following coding conventions:

* SAS libraries files: SASLIB + name.
* Classes and structures names defined using UpperCamelCase.
* Constants and/or variables that should not be modified are full written in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
* Variables and instances for classes and structures have names defined using lowerCamelCase. If two variables are related to each other, add an_underscore.
* Global variables that are often used have a name with a GL_ prefix.
* Functions and methods names using lower_case_with_underscore and the first word is a verb.
